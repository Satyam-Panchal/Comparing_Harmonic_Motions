# Comparing_Harmonic_Motions
In simple harmonic motions acceleration of the particle is directly proportional to its position, But what will happen if acceleration was to be changed with proportionalities of x^3 or x^5? This project plots position-time graphs of such particles to analyze and predict their motions in time.
